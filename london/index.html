But 2020 has made a low-stress family getaway even more enticing. \“There’s never been a better time to take advantage of Kids Free San Diego,\” says Julie Coker, President & CEO of the San Diego Tourism Authority. \“With so many students doing distance learning this fall, Kids Free offers them and their families a chance to get outside for some hands-on activities at one of our attractions or museums. And, as always, the savings are substantial, which is something everyone can appreciate right now.\”<br><br>The deals also reveal how much of San Diego has reopened with new safety protocols in place. Kids ages 3–11 get in free right now at San Diego Zoo and the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, as well as the partially open SeaWorld San Diego and LEGOLAND California. All three are also offering Halloween-style entertainment and activities on weekends, bundled into your admission: the illuminated HalGlowEen at the zoo, SeaWorld Spooktacular at the marine theme park, and Halloween in Miniland at LEGOLAND.<br><br>Kids can also enhance their distance learning with free visits to San Diego\’s floating historic sites, the USS Midway Museum and Maritime Museum, or by perusing the engineering feats at the San Diego Automotive Museum and San Diego Model Railroad Museum, both within the sprawling Balboa Park. For more outdoor fun, take the kids whale watching, or pedal a Surrey bike along the Embarcadero with a deal through Wheel Fun Rentals.<br><br>The freebies also apply to authentic San Diego cuisine. Kids eat for free at restaurants like Galaxy Taco or the Old Town classic Casa Guadalajara, and at lots of hotels, such as Bahia Resort Hotel and Rancho Bernardo Inn (where the whole family can also get a fourth night free). Kids score a welcome gift and scavenger-hunt kit when the family stays at La Jolla’s La Valencia Hotel or a $50 resort-credit \“allowance\” at Paradise Point, the laid-back, casita-style resort set on 44 acres along Mission Bay.<br><br>')">

Cities and towns across the Golden State are increasingly offering more opportunities to experience public art—whether it’s murals that illuminate the history of a destination, or fanciful sculptures that enhance the sweeping landscapes. Next time you’re in these places, listed north to south, don’t miss these photo-op-ready (and mostly free) outdoor artworks.<br><h1>Bears and Paul Bunyan, Del Norte County</h1><br>This North Coast county uses public art to celebrate its connection to nature: Crescent City is dotted with murals (like one commemorating even a long-ago tsunami), while the bridge over the Klamath River features a pair of bears that were painted gold in the 1950s as a prank. At Klamath’s Trees of Mystery, walk the Trail of Tall Tales to see chainsaw carvings of Paul Bunyan, Babe the Blue Ox and other characters, rendered from redwood timbers.<br><h1>Phoenix Rising, Butte County</h1><br>In the Shasta Cascade region, Butte County\’s public art scene looks both backward and forward. In Chico, murals are scattered around downtown, while Oroville\’s murals tip their hat to the area\’s Gold Rush history. In nearby Paradise, don\’t miss the phoenix sculpture outside the town\’s new Building Resiliency Center, made with donated keys from homes lost in the Camp Fire.<br><h1>Alleyway Art Project, Fort Bragg</h1><br>This Mendocino County project sought to bring beauty to \“overlooked\” spots around town, so today you can explore the back end of downtown Fort Bragg with its colorful depictions of rhododendrons, a sea monster, and a vivid mural inspired by an Indian folk tale.<br><h1>Gold Panner Statue, Auburn</h1><br>Visit the historic district in the Placer County town of Auburn to see the 45-ton Claude Chana, Gold Panner monument which honors the prospector who first discovered gold here in 1848. Fun fact: It was created by a local dentist who sculpted other local works in the 1970s.<br><h1>Wide Open Walls, Sacramento</h1><br>These ever-expanding murals in the capital city started as an annual festival, but you can see the impressive works year-round, from landscapes to abstract pieces, giant bunnies, and Johnny Cash. Create your own tour using its website to sort by neighborhood or each year’s collections.<br><h1>Sculpture Trail, Sonoma County</h1><br>The Sonoma County towns of Cloverdale and Geyserville are home to more than 30 large outdoor sculptures, known as the Cloverdale Sculpture Trail. The current assortment (which changes every two years) includes plenty of abstract works, as well as a giant candy apple and a whimsical \“pigasus.\”<br><h1>Napa Art Walk</h1><br>This biennial exhibition of juried sculpture rotates every two years, and is displayed around Downtown Napa. Take the free, self-guided audio tour (available on the Otocast app), vote on your pick for the People\’s Choice Award, and stop in at nice diversions that happen to be located near sculptures, such as the Oxbow Public Market.<br><h1>Sidewalk Art, Benicia</h1><br>Look down as you stroll the sidewalks of downtown Benicia and you\’ll see mosaic tiles by local artist Guillermo Granizo illustrating the historic landmarks, people, and events that have shaped the North Bay town. Start at J Street, then follow along First St.<br><h1>Todos Santos Plaza Utility Boxes, Concord</h1><br>If you visit the Farmer\’s Market in the East Bay town of Concord, notice the colorfully decorated utility boxes that surround Todos Santos Plaza. Next, head down Salvio Street to see the mural depicting a July 4 celebration from 1894 featuring the town founders, the Galindo family.<br><h1>Mission District, San Francisco</h1><br>The Mission District is home to literally hundreds of murals and painted fences, often with themes of social justice or environmental issues. An easy first stop: The Women\’s Building on 18th St., and its MaestraPeace Mural, which was painted by seven female artists in 1994 to celebrate women\’s contributions around the globe.<br><h1>Murals of Santa Cruz</h1><br>Pedal around this bicycle-friendly town to see the city\’s public art, including the 49 murals, sculptures, and more along Pacific Avenue. Make it a game by doing the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History\’s free scavenger hunt, or just by seeking out these public murals, including the museum’s colorful outdoor plaza Abbott Square.<br><h1>Mural District, Fresno</h1><br>Dozens of murals and sculptures line downtown Fresno, saluting everyone from Cesar Chavez to the X-Men and the city of Fresno itself (don\’t miss the giant Postage Stamp mural). On Fulton Street, another mural helpfully IDs the city\’s Brewery District.<br><h1>Art on Fire Hydrant Walk, Visalia</h1><br>Explore the Central Valley town by way of its 18-block Art on Fire display. Check out the 22 colorful fire hydrants painted with flowers, gumball machines, and even a dalmatian. At the western end, stop and smell the flowers at the Ralph S. Moore Rose Garden.<br><h1>Creamery Marketplace, San Luis Obispo</h1><br>Cows are a vital part of the Instagram-ready public art scene in San Luis Obispo. Not only do painted cows still dot the streets thanks to a previous Cow Parade, but a local artists’ gallery is housed in the Creamery Marketplace building, emblazoned with the fabulous cow mural dubbed SLO Irresistible.<br><h1>Bruce Munro: Field of Light, Paso Robles</h1><br>The rolling terrain of Paso Robles makes a good foundation both for excellent vineyards and this stunning light show. Take an evening stroll around this 150-acre light installation created by Bruce Munro, comprised of 58,000 colored-light spheres and accented with live music. Enhance your viewing with food and wine from local vendors. Runs through Jan. 3, 2021.<br><h1>Downtown Murals, Ventura</h1><br>The diversity of this Central Coast town shows in its downtown murals. Start at the mural illustrating Ventura\’s history outside the San Buenaventura Mission, then check out the Tortilla Flats Mural, the China Alley Mural, and Amaterasu (a Shinto sun goddess), all of which celebrate some of Ventura\’s different communities. Amaterasu is just outside Fluid State Beer Garden, a great example of Ventura\’s beer scene.<br><h1>Murals of Burbank</h1><br>It\’s home to many production and animation studios, but the L.A. County town of Burbank offers yet another form of entertainment by way of its growing collection of murals and mosaics. Follow the map of public art to look for a portrait of Frida Kahlo, a work by acclaimed muralist Alex Gonzalez, and one crowd-pleaser mural depicting iconic characters including Darth Vader, James Bond, and Mr. Spock.<br><h1>Arts District, Downtown Los Angeles</h1><br>You can spot murals all over L.A.—like Richard Wyatt Jr.\'s mural of music legends at the Capitol Records building. But the biggest concentration may be in Downtown L.A.\’s Arts District. Don\’t miss the Container Yard section along 4th St., including the couple touching noses or the Americana-meets-California piece featuring a cowboy, a low-rider, and palm trees.<br><h1>Umbrella Alley, Redlands</h1><br>This San Bernardino County town nods to a few European cities with similar installations: Orange Street Alley has 420 blue, yellow, green, and pink umbrellas hanging over the alley entrances between Fifth Street and Orange Street. Enjoy both ambience and shade while browsing local businesses such as Sugarbee Cake & Bake Shop.<br><h1>Etherea, Coachella</h1><br>Even though the Coachella Valley Music & Arts Festival runs for only two weeks in the town of Indio, one souvenir of the iconic April festival remains year-round in downtown Coachella: the luminous wire-mesh sculpture Etherea, created for the 2018 festival, which nods to Baroque and Neoclassical architecture. Don\’t stop there: The rest of Greater Palm Springs is lined with interesting murals, sculptures, and fountains.<br><h1>Art Walk and Murals, Costa Mesa</h1><br>To see why this Orange County town takes pride in being a \“City of the Arts,\” take the Art Walk of sculptures that surround the Segerstrom Center for the Arts (including Joan Miro\’s bronze-bird Oiseau). Keep strolling the town that is home to dozens of murals and painted utility boxes, including a number of pieces at shopping center LAB Anti-Mall.<br><h1>Oceanside\'s Street Mural Walk</h1><br>Seeing dozens of murals is a good way to explore this north San Diego County town that was recently named a California Arts Council Cultural District. Most are by locals (such as pro skater Kris Markovich), and many are on the sides of great places to shop, eat, or drink, such as Revolution Roasters and Masters Kitchen and Cocktail.<br><h1>The Stuart Collection, La Jolla</h1><br>Take a self-guided tour of the campus of the University of California San Diego that focuses on its unique collection of 20 works. Some pieces even blend into the university architecture—like Fallen Star, a tiny blue house that perches precariously on a campus roof, or Vices and Virtues, which flashes messages from a lab building.<br><h1>Balboa Park\’s Sculpture Garden, San Diego</h1><br>The May S. Marcy Sculpture Garden, outside the San Diego Museum of Art, nicely blends art with nature. Not only does it feature 19th- and 20th-century sculptures, but it also offers nice views of Balboa Park\’s California Tower, built for the 1915–16 Panama-California Exposition. The tower is a work of art in itself—a medley of Baroque, Plateresque, Churrigueresque, Rococo, and Gothic styles.<br><h1>Chicano Park, San Diego</h1><br>The Barrio Logan neighborhood has long been a hub for San Diego\’s Mexican-American community, but its artistic nerve center sits beneath the San Diego-Coronado Bridge overpass, which was named a National Historic Landmark in 2017. The bridge\’s pillars provided the canvas for 80 murals—the largest concentration of Chicano murals in the world.<br><h1>Ricardo Breceda\’s Sky Art Sculptures, Borrego Springs</h1><br>A road trip into the desert town of Borrego Springs and Anza-Borrego Desert State Park takes on an otherworldly ambience, thanks in part to the 130 sculptures by renowned artist Ricardo Breceda that populate the area—dinosaurs, horses, a dragon, and more.

If you’ve been dreaming of a California vacation from the comfort of your couch, you now have the option to make that dream come true. As of June 12, hotels across the state were authorized to reopen if approved by county authorities under California Department of Public Health guidelines.<br><br>\“From a state perspective, the government is very optimistic about our numbers. From a consumer perspective, we know that consumers are ready to travel,\” explains Lynn Mohrfeld, president and CEO of the California Hotel and Lodging Association (CHLA). For hotels, the focus has been on creating the safest environment possible. \“In order to welcome guests back, we have created a nine-page Clean + Safe Guidance. We are so prepared, it’s ridiculous.\”<br><br>The guidance was created by CHLA in conjunction with hotel leadership from across the state, as well as COVID-19–specific protocols created by the California Department of Public Health and OSEA. In order to receive Clean + Safe certification, hotels must adhere to the guidelines for guests, employees, and cleaning practices to create a safe environment that allows for social distancing.<br><br>In practice, this means limiting the number of people per elevator; ensuring employees are outfitted with proper protective equipment; washing all towels and linens on the hottest setting; increased sanitation with extra attention paid to higher-touch items, including light switches and remote controls; as well as a host of additional protocols. Mohrfeld says that the guidance remains a dynamic document with regular updates and modifications made to reflect the most up-to-date recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.<br><h1>What to Expect</h1><br>\“Hotels are in the hospitality business, and we will find a way to make guests feel completely comfortable and taken care of,\” Mohrfeld points out. At the same time, you may notice some new social distancing measures as well as limitations to the amenities provided.<br>For example, at the Carneros Resort and Spa in Napa Valley, guests will receive a welcome packet, complete with face mask and hand sanitizer, during their contact-less check-in. The two pools on the 28-acre grounds and spa are open. At Los Angeles County\’s Terranea Resort, the focus is on outdoor activities, including guided coastal hikes where it\’s easy to stay socially distanced. At The Lodge at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, the resort allows for a minimum of 48 hours between guest stays and has expanded room service offerings to provide that resort feel in a safer way.<br><h1>Tips for Travelers</h1><br>Before you embark on your vacation, make sure you are up to speed with travel recommendations outlined by the Centers for Disease Control. It never hurts to review basic safety measures like frequent hand washing, wearing cloth face covers when in public, and staying on the lookout for symptoms.<br><br>Apart from the fundamentals, remember to be respectful of fellow travelers, remain aware of your surroundings, and practice good common sense. And if you are ever unsure about protocol, simply ask.<br><br>\“We use labeling, so guests should never worry if they are doing something right,\” explains Rachel Welsh, spokesperson for The Lodge at Torrey Pines. \“It’s our job to keep our guests well-informed, and we continue our level of luxury by being a resource during this time.\”<br><br>')">

Vacationers craving wide open spaces and outdoor activities have rediscovered the rich allure of California\'s rural towns—especially their easy access to parks and public lands. After all, doesn\'t a little fresh air and freedom sound good right now?<br><br>But before you make a trip to the countryside—whether it\'s a big-name national park, picturesque mountain town, or sea-breezy coastal village—remember that travelers make a big impact everywhere they go. That\'s even more true for rural communities. By practicing the eight good-visitor principles below, your outdoorsy getaway can be great for you and also the small town you\'re visiting.<br><h1>1. Do Your Pre-Trip Homework.</h1><br>Leaving home for a weekend getaway? You probably searched the Web like crazy to find the perfect lodging for your crew. And of course you checked Waze or Google Maps to avoid traffic and roadwork hassles. Nice work. But you still have some planning to do.<br><br>\`Visitors aren\'t always aware that there are different rules in nature-oriented destinations. The forest is not the city,\` says Tony Lyle, Vice President Tourism Development at Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority. \``Different rules apply.\`<br><br>Think about how you\'ll spend your days at your destination, then research the nitty-gritty. Find out the current regulations for your favorite beach, park, trail, or picnic site. Now more than ever, rules vary greatly among parks. For example, visitors need advance reservations to enter Yosemite National Park—you can\'t drive in to the park without them. Some of California\'s national forest lands closed to public access due to fire restrictions in September, so check to ensure your destination is open on the U.S. Forest Service website.<br><h1>2. Treat Your Vacation Home Like It\'s in Your Own Neighborhood.</h1><br>Not so long ago, vacation lodging meant hotels, motels, or campgrounds. Now we often vacation in private homes in residential neighborhoods. Instead of hotel guests for neighbors, we have doctors, schoolteachers, plumbers, chefs, and other working people living right next door—and they might need to get up at 6 a.m.<br><br>Sherry Gardner, who manages six vacation homes outside of Yosemite National Park, says visitors need to be vigilant about quiet-time rules. \`We know people are on vacation and want to let loose, but they must always be respectful about loud music, parties, and yelling,\` she says. \`Visitors sometimes forget that they\'re on vacation but their neighbors aren\'t.\`<br><h1>3. Act Like a Local.</h1><br>Let\'s say you\'re a city- or suburb-dweller on your first trip to a small mountain town. Here\'s the lowdown: The locals don\'t do things the same way you\'re used to. Tailgating? Not cool (slow down on two-lane roads). Playing amplified music on a trail? Not cool (use your earbuds). Leaving trash around? Definitely not cool.<br><br>Lyle says your trip will be better if you adopt the norms of the place you\'re visiting. \`Most of us say we want to \'live like the locals\' when we travel. That doesn\'t apply just to exotic destinations. Living like a local is the best way to travel anywhere.\`<br><br>Rosie Hackett, Director of Outdoor Leadership at Sierra Nevada University, says visitors should look to the locals as role models. \`Visitors coming to a new environment can observe what locals are doing and learn from them,\` she says. \`Watch what the locals do, then model your behavior after them.\`<br><h1>4. Be a Smart Hiker or Camper.</h1><br>Your smartphone makes it easy to find out when the local grocery store is open and whether that Indian restaurant serves tikka masala. You can also use it to find out how many miles you need to walk to get to that waterfall, and how steep the trail is.<br><br>\`Inexperienced hikers go out on the trail and don\'t carry enough water, don\'t carry a map, or don\'t wear good shoes, and they get in trouble,\` Hackett says. Search-and-rescue workers have been busier than ever in 2020, and many rescued hikers are found only a few miles from their cars. A modicum of preparation can prevent most outdoor calamities. For safety advice, see the National Park Service\'s simple tips on its Hike Smart web page.<br><br>Camping trips require good planning, too. Before you go, make reservations to ensure you\'ll get a site. Many campgrounds are closed this year due to COVID or wildfire restrictions. Others have adjusted their rules. \`First-time campers always think that camping means s\'mores over a campfire. They don\'t know that campfires aren\'t allowed in a lot of places,\` Hackett says.<br><h1>5. Become a Trash Steward.</h1><br>Even if you don\'t venture farther than the local beach, you can help protect natural resources by becoming trash-savvy. Lyle says that rural areas need to do a better job of educating people about litter. \`We have electronic signs on the highway that say, \'Pack It In, Pack It Out,\' but many visitors have no idea what we\'re talking about.\`<br><br>City dwellers are used to having easy access to trash cans and bins, but that\'s not the case in rural areas. \`Rural parklands are not like city parks,\` Hackett says. \`Don\'t expect to find trash containers. Or if there is one, it might be full. That\'s when you need to \'pack it out.\' Don\'t pile your trash on top or set it next to the can. That\'s bad for local wildlife and the community.\`<br><br>Hackett always carries a small plastic bag to carry her own trash or pick up any trash she comes across. \`It\'s so easy to leave a place more beautiful by picking up any litter that you find,\` she says.<br><h1>6. Don\'t Be a Selfie Offender.</h1><br>Every year, people fall to their deaths because they ventured too close to the cliff edge for an Instagram-worthy shot. We\'ve all watched too many videos of tourists invading the personal space of bison, bears, and other wild animals. And beautiful natural sites around the globe have been damaged by photo-seeking crowds.<br><br>Stop risking your life and trampling the landscape for social media, no matter how much you want that close-up. You\'re not just endangering yourself, you\'re endangering wildlife—even those cute little chipmunks.<br><br>Instead, use your social media account for good. Tag your posts with #RecreateResponsibly to show how you can enjoy public lands in a safe and responsible way, and inspire others to do the same.<br><h1>7. Remember COVID-19 Hasn\'t Gone Away.</h1><br>Sure, we\'d all like to take a break from virus vigilance, but no matter where we go, COVID-19 doesn\'t take a vacation. Wear a mask. Stay six feet apart. Wash your hands. Follow these simple regulations and you\'ll stay healthy and help small-town businesses stay open.<br><br>\`In terms of practicing COVID protocols, we\'ve noticed compliance fatigue,\` Lyle says. \`People are tired of doing it. But visitors need to follow local laws and help to protect the communities they\'re visiting.\` Want more COVID safety tips? Visit #RecreateResponsibly.<br><h1>8. Yes, You Can Make a Difference.</h1><br>Part of the allure of rural communities are their surrounding public lands, filled with scenic natural landmarks, colorful flora, fascinating wildlife, and historic sites. But most people are completely unaware of their impact on these places. How do we enjoy and protect irreplaceable resources? Hackett says to practice Leave No Trace ethics, which are seven well established principles for minimizing impacts and respecting land and wildlife. \`The Leave No Trace principles apply whether you\'re recreating in a local park, a remote wilderness, or even in your backyard,\` she says.<br><br>Lyle adds that sometimes we think our individual behavior is only a tiny drop in the bucket, so it doesn\'t matter much. \`But every visitor can do something to make a difference,\` he says. \`It comes down to respect for your fellow humans and the environment we live in.\`<br><br>Before you explore California, be sure to visit our Responsible Travel Hub, which includes helpful Travel Updates.

If you haven\’t taken the time to explore Anaheim, you have multiple fun discoveries ahead.<br><h1>Eat at the Packing District</h1><br>Eating doesn\’t get much cooler than this. Just a few miles from Disneyland, three historic landmarks—a 1919 Sunkist orange packing house, a 1925 Packard car dealership, and a 1917 orange marmalade factory—got new leases on life in 2013 as the Anaheim Packing District. The airy renovated warehouse spaces now house Anaheim Brewery, Umami Burger, Unsung Brewing Company, Pali Wine Company, plus the Packing House Food Hall—more than 30 food stalls and restaurants selling everything you could ever want to eat. There\’s grilled cheese, ramen, Cajun seafood, soul food, organic curry, dim sum, Japanese crepes, gelato on a stick, and plenty more. The warehouse décor is as hip as the food. Air plants suspended on dangling ropes drape from the open-beamed ceiling, and BXCR Wine Bar is built into a converted 1920s railroad boxcar.<br><h1>Explore Little Saigon</h1><br>Hundreds of bustling Vietnamese-owned businesses and restaurants pack a three-square-mile area of Westminster and Garden Grove, home to almost 200,000 Vietnamese Americans and one of the largest Vietnamese communities outside of Vietnam. Get a taste of this fascinating area by browsing the Asian Garden Mall (a.k.a. Phuoc Loc Tho), a colorful two-story indoor shopping center filled with baked goods, jewelry, clothes, cosmetics, home goods, and ephemera. Be sure to eat at Little Saigon\’s tantalizing restaurants: Sip perfect pho at Pho 79 or Pho Nguyen Hue, or tuck into banh beo (steamed rice cakes with shrimp) or bun bo hue (beef soup) at zen-like Quán Hy.<br><h1>Simulate Soaring in the Sky</h1><br>Tired of ho-hum get-togethers? This Friday night, take your friends to the Flightdeck Flight Simulation Center to experience the thrill of competing in air-to-air combat while flying at 600 knots. The action happens in simulators, not actual airplanes, but the sensation is astoundingly real. You\’ll dress up in a genuine military-issue flight suit, attend ground school, then hop into one of Flightdeck\’s eight F-16 fighter jet simulators and show off your best Top Gun maneuvers. Your goal is to blow the other jets out of the sky—and not get hit. If you\’re more of a cruiser than a speed demon, try your hand at the commercial airline simulator instead. You\’ll take the controls of a commercial plane and \“fly\” it through the friendly skies.<br><h1>Taste at Noble Ale Works</h1><br>Close to Angel Stadium and the Honda Center, Noble Ale Works is a fun-loving hub for beer connoisseurs. Find your bliss with Nobility—a national-award-winning IPA—or an array of light pilsners, or maybe a Naughty Sauce coffee stout. An industrial warehouse setting and sleek stool-and-barrel seating speak to Noble\’s beer-centric focus. For food, hit up the food trucks parked outside. Anaheim\’s beer scene is hopping—other noteworthy stops include Backstreet Brewery, Karl Strauss, and Golden Road near Angel Stadium; Legends Brewery near Disneyland; Bottle Logic on La Palma; and the Packing District\’s Anaheim Brewery and Unsung Brewing.<br><h1>Play at The Ranch</h1><br>Get out your shiniest silver belt buckle and pointy-toed boots and make an evening of it. Start with dinner at The Ranch, where grand cedar beams and flagstone floors set the stage for upscale cowboy cuisine: Kobe beef carpaccio, bone-in rib-eye, Castroville artichokes, and a wine cellar stocked with more than 10,000 bottles. Then sidle over to The Ranch Saloon to work off your dinner by two-stepping and line dancing. Don\’t know how to do the quick-quick-slow? Free dance lessons are offered Wednesday to Sunday evenings, or you can watch from the sidelines at the 47-foot-long Longhorn Bar.<br>')">

If you\’ve been dreaming of a California getaway, you may be wondering what to expect when renting a vehicle at your Golden State destination. As with other service-related businesses, the COVID-19 pandemic has inspired some significant changes in the way rental car companies operate in order to keep customers and employees safe.<br><br>\“We have always been committed to maintaining the highest standards of cleanliness, but we understand now more than ever that customers should feel confident that their vehicle is clean and sanitized,\” says Lisa Martini, communications director at Enterprise Holdings, owner of Enterprise Rent-A-Car, National Car Rental, and Alamo Rent-A-Car.<br><br>To ensure proper cleaning and sanitation, Enterprise followed guidance from the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), and the U.S. Travel Association to create its \“Complete Clean Pledge.\” The program includes strict sanitation protocols for more than 20 high-touch surfaces, from key fobs to rearview mirrors. It also trains employees in enhanced cleaning procedures for vehicles, shuttles, and branch locations.<br><br>The company has added curbside pick-up, as well as delivery options at some neighborhood locations to help minimize foot traffic at rental offices. Travelers visiting rental branches will notice that all employees are wearing face coverings and that plexiglass shields have been installed at the counters to separate customers and employees.<br><br>Similarly stringent sanitation practices and safety protocols, as well as minimal-touch or touchless rental procedures, have also been adopted at other major rental companies, including Hertz Global Holdings (parent company of Hertz Car Rental, Dollar Car Rental, and Thrifty Car Rental) and the Avis Budget Group, owner of Avis and Budget Rent a Car.<br><br>\“We believe car rental is one of the cleanest and safest forms of transportation because it puts customers in control of their own environment,\” says Catie Valzania, public relations account executive for the Avis Budget Group. \“We will continue to look to the CDC, along with state and local guidelines, in our ongoing efforts to optimize the cleanliness of our facilities and vehicles, while working to keep our employees and customers safe.\”<br><h1>Get the Latest Info</h1><br>To learn more about individual rental car companies\’ pandemic-related protocols and safety practices, check out the major providers\’ COVID-19 response pages for information and updates: Alamo, Avis, Budget, Enterprise, Hertz, National, Thrifty. While you\’re visiting, jump over to the companies\’ home pages to find out about discounts and deals.<br><br>Whether you\’re planning to hunker down in one spot or drive through several California regions during your visit, it\’s helpful to get the latest updates on local shelter-in-place regulations. Visit California\’s Responsible Travel Hub is an essential trip-planning resource, and be sure to check in with your destination\’s official COVID-19 pages for updated regional information.<br><br>Also, while there are no official restrictions on public restrooms, many businesses—including some gas stations and fast food restaurants—have closed their restrooms out of an abundance of caution. If you are embarking on a long road trip, consult the California Rest Areas map as part of your advance planning.<br><h1>Safe Rental Tips</h1><br>Here are some steps you can take to ensure a safe and smooth car rental experience in California.<br><br>Check cancelation policies: Most major rental companies are offering free changes and cancellations during the pandemic, even for pre-paid rentals, but it\’s wise to check before you book. Third-party websites may have their own rules, so read the fine print before you commit.<br><br>Stick to Your Circle: According to health experts, exposure to droplets from an infected person poses the greatest risk for contracting COVID-19. In tight spaces such as cars and SUVs, make sure you\’re traveling with people in your immediate circle, such as family members or close friends.<br><br>Skip the Line: Many car rental companies are now offering touchless check-ins for online reservations, so customers can skip the line at the counter. You may need to sign up in advance for a free rewards program to access this service, but it will save you time in the long run and limit your contact with other customers.<br><br>BYO Wipes: Rental car companies are going above and beyond to make sure their vehicles are thoroughly sanitized. However, if you\’d like some extra peace of mind, bring some disinfecting wipes along for the ride. When doing DIY wipe-downs, focus on high-touch surfaces like the steering wheel, interior door handles, and the rearview mirror. It\’s also smart to keep hand sanitizer in the vehicle for stops along the way.')">
